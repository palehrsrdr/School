1.	If you switch from camo or environment maps to none
on ship on the web page, it will not draw textures on any of the
objects unless you apply an environment option. When camo or
environment maps selected, ship is only object with texture.
( It works until you select shadows. So something in shadows is
     causing it to break.)



2. Selecting Camo and Shadows at the same time causes the ship
to be drawn with the clear color.
